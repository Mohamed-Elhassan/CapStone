# Hi, Iâ€™m Mohamed ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio. Iâ€™m a developer in New Hampshire, currently finishing my CS capstone at SNHU.

- Front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular)  
- Back-end APIs (Node.js, Express)  
- Data modeling & management (MongoDB)  
- API integrations (REST, GraphQL)
