# Hi, I’m Mohamed 👋

Welcome to my Computer Science ePortfolio. I’m a developer in New Hampshire, currently finishing my CS capstone at SNHU.

## What I Do

Right now, my focus is on expanding my cloud skills—learning AWS services, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code. I have experience with:

- Front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular)  
- Back-end APIs (Node.js, Express)  
- Data modeling & management (MongoDB)  
- API integrations (REST, GraphQL)  
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)  
- Agile methodologies & project management (Jira, Custom made project tracker)  
- Containerization & orchestration (Docker)  

## Featured Projects

1. **180S**  
   A full‑stack fitness app that fetches a “Workout of the Day” from ChatGPT and stores plans in MongoDB. Allows users to create accounts to save meal plans and workouts.
   Admins can login and remove/add plans or change the workouts.
