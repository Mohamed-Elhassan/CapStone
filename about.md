# About Me

I’m Mohamed Elhassan, a Computer Science student at SNHU finishing up my capstone project. I grew up in New Hampshire and found my passion in building web applications that solve real‑world problems. My journey started with front‑end work using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then expanded into back‑end development with Node.js and Express, and eventually led me to explore cloud technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code.

When I’m not coding, you can find me experimenting with small Raspberry Pi hardware projects, at the gym, or exploring many other activites Im interested in.
